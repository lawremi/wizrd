#+TITLE: wizrd: An R Interface to LLMs

The wizrd package enables embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) in R
programs by treating them as functions with structured inputs and
outputs. Features include tool calling, prompt templating, convenient
encoding of examples and interconversion of JSON and S7
objects. Supports local and remote LLMs, including Ollama, llama.cpp,
OpenAI and Azure, via an abstraction that is extensible to other
providers. There is experimental support for text embedding, vector
stores and Results Augmented Generation (RAG).

See the vignette(s) and manual for more details.
