#+TITLE: wizrd: An R Interface to Large Language Models

* Overview

The wizrd package enables embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) in R
programs by treating them as functions with structured inputs and outputs. It
supports local and remote LLMs, including Ollama, llama.cpp, OpenAI, and Azure,
via an extensible abstraction. Features include prompt templating, tool calling,
and experimental support for text embedding, vector stores, and Results
Augmented Generation (RAG).

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lawremi/wizrd")
#+END_SRC

* Quick Start

#+BEGIN_SRC R
library(wizrd)

# Use a local LLM (requires Ollama)
agent <- llama()
predict(agent, "Describe the mtcars dataset")
#+END_SRC

For advanced usage, including parameterized prompts, tool calling, structured
output, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), see the package vignette:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
vignette("wizrd")
#+END_SRC
